https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/

## To-do
- O que precisa ser feito no dia (sempre acabar o dia vazio)
	- Como relacionar com hábitos em Way of Life
- Finanças

## Plan
1. Define projects
2. Manifest active projects across tools
3. Manifest categories (PARA) across tools

## Databases
- Projects
	- Series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline
	- A project without a goal is a hobby
	- A goal without a project is a dream
	- Define your projects, or they will define you
- Areas
	- A sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time, with indefinite end date
	- Know the extent of your commitment
	- Connect the efforts to long term goals
	- Know if you're making progress toward your goals
- Tasks
	- Are inside either Projects or Areas (at least one, and ideally not both at the same time)

## Collections
- Resource
	- A topic or theme of ongoig interest
	- Might be reviewed from time to time to assess whether there's any action to me taken, or anything to pursue more seriously
	- This is where research lives; content here tent to have the most objectively valuable information to access when looking for

- Archives
	- Inactive items from the other 3 categories
	- Mostly projects
	- Can also be used for project retrospectives, annual retrospectives, and resumes or proposals that need to show your work
