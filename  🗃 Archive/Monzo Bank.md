	- fincrime is a remaining one where the need came up
- there are 3 senior ae managers, all reporting to data directors
### Pitch
- Chat with Annabel
	- The first one, after having a lot more clarity after our last chat and my research, is in the relocation process itself. I've come to relevant conclusions such as that (1) most of the £5k support, after 40-45% tax discounts, should be fully directed to remaining costs with the relocation such as downpayment for rent and maybe operational costs to bring personal and home belongings, and (2) on top of the Visa and UK entry support I'll also need to figure out a lot of the legal part on the Brazilian side to avoid being subject to doubling taxes.
	- The second one is, when I look at the comparative progression I'm set to have in the next steps here at the current and near-future positions at Nubank, I'm not yet 100% comfortable with the compensation aspect as it also fell a little short from my initial expectations.
	- From our last conversation, I understand the concern about guaranteeing internal equity at the team. Because of that, I'm comfortable to go from the salary of £125k as the base scenario, also by trusting that there will be a lot of relevant opportunities to build concrete business impact in this position and, with that, consolidate inside the company in this and the next level.
	- Still, the difference between the base pay and the floor of my expectations is still £15k, and also other factors such as the liquidity of Nubank's stocks and the expected 10-15% salary raise in February make the overall offer come a bit short of what I would consider a fair opportunity at this point.
	- Also, there is the relevant aspect of the first stock package at Nubank vesting at the 1st of April, when I would still need to be an active employee, for a converted gross total of £18k. Income taxes for this type of benefit in Brazil revolve around 15%, which is also a lot different than in the UK and impacts the final take-home value.
	- Considering that, but also our mutual interest in making this opportunity work for both sides, I'd like to propose a scenario where we can compensate a part of this difference:
		- Extending Fragomen's support, or through a similar provider, to the full extend of the relocation process, including a series of details about existing investments in Brazil, understanding about tax agreements between the countries, and so on.
		- Compensating Nubank's stock grant due on April through a signing bonus of £27,8k, which already accounts for the tax value difference in my fixed pay range.
		- In this scenario, I'd be happy to join the team as early as the first half of March given that the Visa process allows for it.
- Reinforcing match with opportunity
	- For almost 3 months now I've been working with the leadership in Lending, which is one of the most relevant BUs at Nubank, to determine a strategy and vision for our data stack, particularly as we progress to developing future plans to expand internationally.
	- Paolo particularly told me more about the challenge in determining the correct amount of friction we want to add to the final customer's process while also keeping the company's interests at hand, and how the data structure is essential in that process.
	- There is definitely not a straightforward answer to that, and I genuinely think that my experience can collaborate a lot on that sense, both in this more recent example but while leading the team and architecture definition for expansion at Loft as well.
### Questions
- Leveling aspect interferes with compensation and with learning and progression inside the team. Understanding more in depth how both the company and the team's leadership address it is very relevant for beginning this relationship with trust.
- Premises: not joining with high expectations to progress quickly, but looking to get out of a similar scenario that happened with Nubank.
- What are the most senior AEs, both ICs Managers, in the company contributing for?
- What does career progression look like, particularly for senior contributors? How long is an usual tenure in each level?
- Something I feel at Nubank is the fact that we don't have many senior contributors in the job family, and every time it unifies at the business level. I understand Monzo works somewhat like that for Data Directors. Could you walk me through it?
- How well are the expectations for each level defined?
### Examples
- Raising the bar for the Analytics team at Loft (**technical bar**)
	- Context: Loft is a Brazilian startup on the real estate market, and at the time had around 3,000 employees and 40 engineering squads. There, I went from being the 6th person to Senior Manager of the whole 32-person team
	- S: At the beginning, more than half the analytics team at the company had no experience with SQL. We couldn't level expectations by the bottom, but also trusted the people we had and were demanded by a high business growth moment.
	- T: 
	- A: Develop principles for the team, using the Decision Stack framework, and continuously bring clarity to what was the expected ladder as we and the company developed it
	- R: Created a team culture where everyone started pushing each other forward and key team members with good knowledge started to stand out
- Loft's path to break-even (**handling ambiguity**)
	- Context: Loft is a Brazilian startup on the real estate market, and at the time had around 3,000 employees and 40 engineering squads. There, I went from being the 6th person to Senior Manager of the whole 32-person team.
	- S: Mainly after Series C and D investment rounds, Loft parallelized a lot of initiatives and business units, either by internal efforts or M&As. I led the growing Analytics team that was responsible for supporting all new initiatives. When the market started to become uncertain after COVID, the company decided that it would focus on breaking-even faster than it had previously planned.
	- T: Not only keep up with changing priorities, but influence and guide them - take an active position in the company instead of going with the flow.
	- A: Make sure I earned a seat at most relevant tables and built a trust relationship with relevant leaders in the company
	- R: 
- Change from direct leader to indirect leader at Loft (**self-reflect**)
	- Context: Loft is a Brazilian startup on the real estate market, and at the time had around 3,000 employees and 40 engineering squads. This happened just after my transition from leading 12 direct reports to leading 1, 2 and then 5 direct managers with 32 people in the team
	- S: 
	- T: 
	- A: Generate an indirect impact in the company, while delegating most of the tasks that were previously my "center of gravity" e.g. processes and data modeling on dbt
	- R:
- Creating the Analytics Ops team at Loft (**being proactive**)
	- S: 
	- T: 
	- A: 
	- R: 
- Handling team growing from 6 to 12 direct reports and syncing with other leaders at Loft (**dealing with people**)
	- S: 
	- T: Continue developing people, while I had to keep sync with 2 Product and 2 Engineering Directors to ensure prioritization
	- A: Develop routines, first principles, and leverage collective wisdom
	- R: 
- Nubank Landing Time (**technical challenge**)
	- Context: Nubank runs all analytical and risk model data in one single monolithic ETL, with complete DAG executions every day
	- S: Growing time to process credit policies for the Lending business, up to 80 hours. That meant more concurrent executions to keep up with (at any given point there are 3 different "days as of" running) and lag in getting data to business users
	- T: Reduce time to process the ETL, while maintaining governance and quality standards and keeping sync with 40+ BAs, DSs and business leaders.
	- A: Implemented an incremental structure that decouples the output of models and policies through snapshots. Less than 1% of Nubank's data platform uses incrementalization at the moment.
	- R: Reduced the Landing Time to 36 hours, as well as reducing the number of incidents from dependencies in the models lineage.
## Counter offer for negotiation
### Email for context
Hi, Annabel

Thank you again for your support and time dedicated to clarifying all the questions in the process. It's being a pleasure understanding better the team's challenges for 2025 and onwards.

I'm confident that my previous experience can contribute a lot to Monzo's challenges in FinCrime, particularly bridging a lot of our expansion thoughts at Nubank to support the process of expanding the team.

As we discussed earlier this week, I'd like to work together with you on the offer to remove some blockers for starting my journey with Monzo. Would you be up for a 30-min chat on Monday?

Thanks and talk soon,
Felippe

- Therapy: App MindUp, Health covers some 
- £5000 signing bonus
### Rationale and pitch
- Start by thanking you again for the time and energy dedicated to our conversation.
- I'm excited by the thoughts of being a part of Monzo's team in 2025 and help building the company forward.
- Chats with Paolo and Francesco were very nice to get a feel for the team's challenges, and I feel there is a lot of synergy between them and the experience I can bring to the team.
	- For almost 3 months now I've been working with the leadership in Lending, which is one of the most relevant BUs at Nubank, to determine a strategy and vision for our data stack, particularly as we progress to developing future plans to expand internationally.
	- Paolo particularly told me more about the challenge in determining the correct amount of friction we want to add to the final customer's process while also keeping the company's interests at hand, and how the data structure is essential in that process.
	- There is definitely not a straightforward answer to that, and I genuinely think that my experience can collaborate a lot on that sense, both in this more recent example but while leading the team and architecture definition for expansion at Loft as well.
- Being very transparent, as we've both been since the beginning of the process, there are two aspects I'd still need your help with.
- The first one, after having a lot more clarity after our last chat and my research, is in the relocation process itself. I've come to relevant conclusions such as that (1) most of the £5k support, after 40-45% tax discounts, should be fully directed to remaining costs with the relocation such as downpayment for rent and maybe operational costs to bring personal and home belongings, and (2) on top of the Visa and UK entry support I'll also need to figure out a lot of the legal part on the Brazilian side to avoid being subject to doubling taxes.
- The second one is, when I look at the comparative progression I'm set to have in the next steps here at the current and near-future positions at Nubank, I'm not yet 100% comfortable with the compensation aspect as it also fell a little short from my initial expectations.
- From our last conversation, I understand the concern about guaranteeing internal equity at the team. Because of that, I'm comfortable to go from the salary of £125k as the base scenario, also by trusting that there will be a lot of relevant opportunities to build concrete business impact in this position and, with that, consolidate inside the company in this and the next level.
- Still, the difference between the base pay and the floor of my expectations is still £15k, and also other factors such as the liquidity of Nubank's stocks and the expected 10-15% salary raise in February make the overall offer come a bit short of what I would consider a fair opportunity at this point.
- Also, there is the relevant aspect of the first stock package at Nubank vesting at the 1st of April, when I would still need to be an active employee, for a converted gross total of £18k. Income taxes for this type of benefit in Brazil revolve around 15%, which is also a lot different than in the UK and impacts the final take-home value.
- Considering that, but also our mutual interest in making this opportunity work for both sides, I'd like to propose a scenario where we can compensate a part of this difference:

	- Compensating Nubank's stock grant due on April through a signing bonus of £27,8k, which already accounts for the tax value difference in my fixed pay range.
	- In this scenario, I'd be happy to join the team as early as the first half of March given that the Visa process allows for it.
- Finally, I want to reinforce how I'm really excited by all our conversations and the opportunity to help taking the team to a next level, and how I strongly believe I have a lot to contribute in an even more diverse way. If you think that makes sense, I'd even be open to exploring these past technical and strategic experiences in more depth in an additional chat with the team, as a way to support these asks and arguments.
## Catch-up with Annabel
- Decision-making framework
	- Opportunities in the position and the challenge
		- Mostly covered by the previous chats and very positive perception
		- Wondering about career progression and salary review (I'm already expecting and set to have a 10-15% increase in salary in Feb-Mar/25 at Nubank)
	- Compensation package
		- Net after factoring cost of living which is really high
		- Understand how to consider some of the benefits and deductions in the calculators or simulations
	- Relocation timeline and conditions
		- Time it takes for the visa to be approved
		- Timeline for compensation package in April (around £18k)
		- Timeline for handling resignation (usually 30 days after that)

- Notes
	- 111 pounds/month for private healthcare
	- medicash para reembolso
	- sem certeza se cobre terapia
	- which visa we would apply
	- flexibility on work scheme
	- usually once a month for other people
	- benefits for distributed
	- pay review usually in April (probably just miss)
	- goal for 6 months
	- technical framework is a promotion every year
	- 

Benefit in Kind (BIK) Benefits in kind can be thought of as assets or services (or ‘fringe benefits’) used personally by a Monzonaut but where Monzo pays for the access to these fringe benefits. When you receive anything from Monzo which benefits you personally, and isn’t “wholly, exclusively and necessary” for the purposes of your work with Monzo, it’s likely you’ve received a benefit in kind. Benefits in kind are taxed in order to prevent you from replacing your salary with benefits instead.

Salary Sacrifice A salary sacrifice scheme is an arrangement between you and Monzo, where you give up or ‘sacrifice’ a portion of your salary in exchange for other, non-cash benefits; e.g. Pension. Reducing your salary in this way will reduce your gross (pre-tax) salary. Because your gross wages are now smaller, you’ll pay less income tax and National Insurance (NI) on your earnings.
## General questions for Annabel
- Offer conditions
	- Support on simulating discount and taxes values - is an estimate of 40% accurate?
		- The benefits that mention salary sacrifice are because that’s discounted at paycheck, and before discounts are applied, is that right?
		- Calculators have a tax code, what is it?
	- Strike Price of Stock Options is less than £0.01?
	- Remote, Hybrid or In-Person work?
		- Remote (no expected number of days at the office), but UK only?
		- How the team is usually working? How many people are attending the office on an average week?
	- Benefits 
		- Private Healthcare: do you have material that better details the conditions, also including the extra cost for family members? How much is the BIK?
		- What is the difference between private healthcare and health cash?
		- Are the benefits for "distributed monzonauts" (home set-up contribution, travel & accomodation, monitor) included?
	- Salary reviews and career progression

- Relocation and visa process
	- Could you share an overview of how the visa process works?
	- How does the relocation support works, particularly visa and plane tickets, for my partner?
	- What is the visa type we'd apply for? That influences some of the calculations as far as I could gather
- Timeline
	- You had mentioned the whole process can take up to 3 months. Is that the expected timeline, and is it influenced by any factors we both can control?
	- Teria algum formato em que teriam interesse de começar a trabalhar do Brasil?
- Compensation
	- Support on legal advice on how to make the transition
	- Total Nubank RSUs on April 1st:

## Offer

Hi Felippe 👋

I'm delighted to make you a formal offer to join us as Analytics Engineering Lead 🎉 We all really enjoyed chatting with you and think you'll make a brilliant addition to Monzo!

Your compensation package will be £125,000 per year and a new joiner grant of £150,000 in Monzo share options 💸

You'll also receive a relocation bonus of £5,000 💰
This will be paid in your first pay check. If you decide to leave Monzo before your first year anniversary, a time apportioned repayment will need to be repaid. This bonus is paid via payroll, and will be subject to tax withholding.🚨

A few facts about options at Monzo 📈
• We completed a Series I funding round in 2024 that valued Monzo at £4bn
• Following Series I, each Monzo share has a price of £14.4125. This share price is subject to change and the number of options you are granted will be based on the share price at the time of grant.
• You will be granted options within 3 months of joining Monzo, in the next option granting cycle (currently quarterly), but they will start vesting based on the date you join Monzo
• These options have an exercise price (the price at which you can buy a Monzo share) of less than a penny
• The number of options you will be granted is calculated by dividing the grant value quoted above by Monzo’s share price on the date of grant (currently £14.4125), less the exercise price
• These options vest over 4 years with a 1-year cliff 🏔️  (i.e. 25% vest on the first anniversary)
• Every two years you'll be eligible to receive a ‘refresher’ options grant. Any options granted will be subject to the rules of the relevant employee share plan and the options framework in place at that time.
• When you change roles, or get promoted, you may also receive additional options.

More detailed information about how options at Monzo work are in our option FAQs doc, which is attached to this email.

We also offer a range of benefits 🌴
Like holiday & parental leave, pensions, and more! I've attached a PDF with more details on these.

We'll also pay for your flights and accommodation ✈️
In addition to your relocation allowance, we'll pay for your flights to London and 2 weeks'/1 month's accommodation. We'll book this via a system called TravelPerk after you've signed your Monzo employment contract.

You’ll need to pass background & reference checks before you can start working for us 🛂
If you accept this offer, we'll send you an employment contract. After you’ve signed your contract, we’ll do identity, right to work, and basic criminal history checks. Normally, we run these in the UK, so please let us know if you've lived somewhere else for more than 6 months, in the last 6 years. We'll also need three years' of employment history to do basic reference checks. We'll always try to verify references directly with the company, but in case we can't, our background check provider may ask you for payslips, employment contract or give you the option to download an HMRC report to prove employment instead.

Monzo is a member of Cifas so we will also check your information against their fraud database. For more information on this, please check our candidate privacy notice.

Checks can take up to three weeks to clear (longer if we run them outside of the UK), and you won't be able to start working for us until they have. If you have any concerns, let me know and we’ll talk them through.

Next steps

When you’re ready to accept 🤞, let us know:

• your full name and home address so we can prepare a contract for you to review and sign
• the first Monday you'd be available to start (we have start dates every 2 weeks. The closest to the end of your notice period are 24/2/2025, 10/3/2025 but flexible around relocation plans )
• what countries you've lived in over the last 6 years
• and that you agree to us passing your contact details over to Fragomen to coordinate your visa sponsorship
• If you would prefer a 14" or a 16" MacBook (ℹ️ 14" is smaller and lighter, recommended for the regular commuters and general move about-ers. 16" - A tad heavier but with noticeably bigger screen and slightly longer battery life, a bit less portable and much more suitable for a more static, home-working setup.)

If you'd like to chat about the compensation package or anything else, let me know so I can give you a call.

We'd also love your honest feedback on our interview process so we can improve it in future. We'll email you a link to a short survey soon.
## Collaboration Interview
### People
- Dyana Rose: Senior Backend Engineer
- Hayden Faulds
### About me
- Pitch
	- Music -> QMUL
	- Data Mining
	- Worked in startups since 2013
	- Loft - from 6th person to Senior Manager of the whole 32-person team
	- Implemented and re-implemented the data platform, including dbt, heavy usage of Looker, internal Data Platform and Analytics Engineering teams
	- Had the opportunity to share some times, including at Coalesce, where I also got dbt Certified
	- Team went from 32 to 6 people, I focused on People Analytics but didn't have the room in the company to continue growing at an IC career
	- Made the migration to IC at Nubank, working in depth with Spark and generating direct impact in lineage and costs
- Quick results
	- Shaping the analytical platform while making other people in the team perform better
	- Hunting, selecting and training more than 80% of the team
	- Holistic view on how the company works, a lot of times creating connections between teams
		- Finance/FP&A <> other teams to define concepts and metrics, as well as data sources
		- Bridge between engineering and operations teams in defining processes to derive good quality data
	- Implementing modern data stack tools and being featured more than once in workshops or events (e.g. Databricks, Looker, Coalesce)
- FAQ
	- Why Monzo
		- I'm considering leaving my current company in such a short tenure due to (1) culture differences between senior leaders, making it so that teams don't feel like being in the same boat, and (2) lack of support from my current senior leadership to Data in the BU - it can be solved in internal movements.
		- I've participated on 0-1, 1-100, now 100-
		- Continuing to internationalize the career, Nubank is already a very diverse and international company and product, but me and my partner are in a moment in our lives to make these kinds of movements
	- Why AE
		- Understanding why and the types of problems it was created to solve
		- Deep belief that Analytics is and can be developed as a discipline
		- Can solve concrete problems of people using data, as well as getting more business users to interact with well-modeled data assets
### Keep in mind
- (1) 15min: traditional interview-style questions (draw examples from times that I've worked with engineers, challenges) -> get a gauge of how I've led in previous collaboration experiences with engineers
- (2) 45min: case study
- They’ll make suggestions that maybe aren’t the best way to go about it
### Possible questions
- Tell me about the hardest data pipeline you have worked on. What makes it hard/complex?
	- Nubank's: amount of assets (more than 150 thousand datasets - worked on a project to reduce from 80 to 36h in landing time), amount of owner teams, amount of applications involved to deploy everything. The fact that the whole ETL is a proprietary project coded in Scala makes it a very high entry barrier, as well as making sure people in the company are not only "internal specialists" but can work on top of first principles
	- Analytical and Production usage in the same place, as well as a lot of different use cases
	- It won't be possible to abstract or control everything, but at the same time it doesn't make sense for everyone to optimize only their own part
- How have you worked with backend engineers before? What do you do when they don't collaborate e.g. don't want to fix issues that affect data downstream?
	- Examples below (Data Contracts and Data Modeling)
	- Fixing data issues: focus on (1) analyzing business impact to keep us honest with an "owner not renter" mindset, and (2) giving visibility of the consequences for the analytics team and for consumers of the data (e.g. through incident management)
	- Eventually escalate if necessary
- Backend engineers have an incident of when they emitted the events incorrectly. These events are then stored in a data warehouse and used in downstream data models. How do you respond to this incident?
	- First of all give visibility to the business
	- Understand the criticality of the data: is it used in a production flow (e.g. determining credit underwriting decisions), in which case it needs to be rolled back to a previous version with urgency, or in internal analytical workflows?
	- Break down into first response (be in the same page: is it a bug or is it expected due to some change), which may or may not include some kind of reprocessing capability, and the final correction, which will most likely involve several teams and days (e.g. make sure the impact is addressed but also that we're not putting water inside a leaking bucket)
	- Make sure there is a postmortem to develop new processes and agreements between teams
### Examples from previous collaboration with engineers
- Creation of Data Contracts for data ingestion at Loft
	- Context: Loft is a Brazilian startup on the real estate market, and at the time had around 3,000 employees and 40 engineering squads. There, I went from being the 6th person to Senior Manager of the whole 32-person team
	- S: A centralized Data Platform squad had just been recreated in the company, and most squads were already available for the ingestion from their services to the Data Lake, but we had very frequent data quality incidents (at least 2 a day).
	- T: It was necessary to understand and solve the main root causes behind these data quality issues, since at first it seemed like they were solely on the Analytics side.
	- A: I've represented the Analytics team in a cross-company initiative that defined and implemented the incident management process, in which we observed that most of the weekly data quality incidents were related to the quality of data generated by the services. With that, I worked together with the Data Platform team to define and implement the tooling and processes to what eventually became an internal Data Contracts solution implemented on top of the ingestion phase, conforming raw data to a set of expectations (e.g. schema, quality checks)
		- Implemented in Python, deployed with the Databricks API reading JSON or AVRO schemas defined by owner teams and comparing to data loaded to S3 via Stitch
	- R: Within the same quarter, we've reduced from 10 to 1 data quality incident a week, increasing the maturity of critical pipelines and clearly assigning responsibilities in the process
- Modeling data for new business units and products at Loft
	- Context: Loft is a Brazilian startup on the real estate market, and at the time had around 3,000 employees and 40 engineering squads. There, I went from being the 6th person to Senior Manager of the whole 32-person team
	- S: Mainly after Series C and D investment rounds, Loft parallelized a lot of initiatives and business units, either by internal efforts or M&As. I led the growing Analytics team that was responsible for supporting all new initiatives.
	- T: Improve Data Warehouse modeling with new initiatives, while determining requisites from engineering teams for which data should be made available.
	- A: Synced with engineers and product managers to help explain why it was important to have data as part of the "definition of done" and not as an additional task, as well as debating whether entities in the production environment should or not match the ones in the analytical environment.
	- R: Successfully established end-to-end analytics for all products and BUs.
- Creating a coupling layer between raw and processed data at Nubank
	- So that engineering teams continue to have autonomy over their services' structures, while maintaining data contracts requirements
### Questions
1. One thing that can give teams goosebumps just as well as be a competitive advantage for the company is the interface between productive and analytical data. I've seen articles about Monzo building a feature store. Could you share a bit more on your point of view of the parts of it that have been working well and also where there is still room for improvement?
2. I've also seen in one of Monzo's blog articles the mention of every data source having a team assigned as owner. How well that functions in practice in your point of view?

### Keep in mind
- Example-based questions and interview
### Examples
- Raising the bar for the Analytics team at Loft (**technical bar**)
	- Context: Loft is a Brazilian startup on the real estate market, and at the time had around 3,000 employees and 40 engineering squads. There, I went from being the 6th person to Senior Manager of the whole 32-person team
	- S: At the beginning, more than half the analytics team at the company had no experience with SQL. We couldn't level expectations by the bottom, but also trusted the people we had and were demanded by a high business growth moment.
	- T: 
	- A: Develop principles for the team, using the Decision Stack framework, and continuously bring clarity to what was the expected ladder as we and the company developed it
	- R: Created a team culture where everyone started pushing each other forward and key team members with good knowledge started to stand out
- Loft's path to break-even (**handling ambiguity**)
	- Context: Loft is a Brazilian startup on the real estate market, and at the time had around 3,000 employees and 40 engineering squads. There, I went from being the 6th person to Senior Manager of the whole 32-person team.
	- S: Mainly after Series C and D investment rounds, Loft parallelized a lot of initiatives and business units, either by internal efforts or M&As. I led the growing Analytics team that was responsible for supporting all new initiatives. When the market started to become uncertain after COVID, the company decided that it would focus on breaking-even faster than it had previously planned.
	- T: Not only keep up with changing priorities, but influence and guide them - take an active position in the company instead of going with the flow.
	- A: Make sure I earned a seat at most relevant tables and built a trust relationship with relevant leaders in the company
	- R: 
- Change from direct leader to indirect leader at Loft (**self-reflect**)
	- Context: Loft is a Brazilian startup on the real estate market, and at the time had around 3,000 employees and 40 engineering squads. This happened just after my transition from leading 12 direct reports to leading 1, 2 and then 5 direct managers with 32 people in the team
	- S: 
	- T: 
	- A: Generate an indirect impact in the company, while delegating most of the tasks that were previously my "center of gravity" e.g. processes and data modeling on dbt
	- R:
- Creating the Analytics Ops team at Loft (**being proactive**)
	- S: 
	- T: 
	- A: 
	- R: 
- Handling team growing from 6 to 12 direct reports and syncing with other leaders at Loft (**dealing with people**)
	- S: 
	- T: Continue developing people, while I had to keep sync with 2 Product and 2 Engineering Directors to ensure prioritization
	- A: Develop routines, first principles, and leverage collective wisdom
	- R: 
- Nubank Landing Time (**technical challenge**)
	- Context: Nubank runs all analytical and risk model data in one single monolithic ETL, with complete DAG executions every day
	- S: Growing time to process credit policies for the Lending business, up to 80 hours. That meant more concurrent executions to keep up with (at any given point there are 3 different "days as of" running) and lag in getting data to business users
	- T: Reduce time to process the ETL, while maintaining governance and quality standards and keeping sync with 40+ BAs, DSs and business leaders.
	- A: Implemented an incremental structure that decouples the output of models and policies through snapshots. Less than 1% of Nubank's data platform uses incrementalization at the moment.
	- R: Reduced the Landing Time to 36 hours, as well as reducing the number of incidents from dependencies in the models lineage.
### Questions
1. Analytics Engineering team created 3 or 4 years ago for most companies. Strengthening the chapter's identity and helping to raise the bar for AE contributors and leaders in the company is one of the best contributions I can make. Based on that, I want to understand better your point of view on:
	- The good and the bad for Analytics Engineering teams at the company
	- How is the team perceived by stakeholders
1. I understand this position is for the EU Expansion team. Could you share a bit more about why the opening was created, and what would success mean in 3 and 6 months for me in this position?
### Notes
- AE in 2021, promoting a decentralized data model that DSs and MLEs built themselves
- Hub owns centralized models (e.g. users), also run the engineering or scheduling works
- Hub working closer with engineers (e.g. events propagated wrong)
- Hub bringing more standardization
- Challenge in AEs getting business context to determine where to make improvements
- Launching new products
- EU is the big opportunity - e.g. hardcoded references for GBP
- How the platform scales for more currencies and use cases
- There is an account in the US as well - basically copying and pasting
- How the models need to change 
- Team of 2 recently senior AEs
- Making Monzo most country agnostic as possible

### Keep in mind
- Have some time to digest, keep pen & paper at hand
- Voice assumptions and understanding
- Case studies are ambiguous by nature
- (1) code interpretation and ownership
	- Shown a SQL query written by a data scientist that runs but doesn't return as expected. There is a UDF function.
	1. How would you understand the data/query (r.: CTEs, data catalog, data profiling, go through examples in the data from the beginning to the end, understand the UDF)
	2. How would you fix the query? (r.: check for filters and duplicate data, understand if we indeed need the UDF since it can cause complexity and maybe performance issues)
	3. What would you do when asked to own the query? (r.: set it up in the appropriate place in dbt's structure, standardize formatting e.g. indentation, configuring tests e.g. unique, not_null, accepted_values, and unit tests), and moving to an incremental model
- (2) architectural thinking
	- Shown an ERD of a DB with 4 tables. Talking about a data model and answering specific analytical questions.
	- There may be missing data from the original database, that would make it complex to replicate business logic in the analytical environment.
	- Questions
		- We need to produce as accurate a view as possible of:
			1. The transactions that related to the financial crime trigger
			2. All the actions taken by customer support agent relating to fincrime
			3. Whether an investigation led to account closure
			How would you want to produce the best view?
			What are the advantages and limitations of your approach?
			What changes would you want to make?
	- Actions
		- Add transaction id (or ids) to fincrime trigger
		- Filter only relevant customer support actions 
		- Select the transactions that the customer support action was implemented on top of
		- Have an account closure event, with a closing reason information
#### Possible questions
- How would you create a table to unify customer transaction and account type data at scale?
	- Understand the concepts behind the sources, through queries, documentation, and syncs with owner teams in the company. Also understand what data tests are applied behind them
	- Determine the end-result through a first query, aiming to make sure the results are under what I expect
	- Understand the behavior of the sources and the end result to understand if it's possible to use incrementalization to reduce the number of rows processed
	- Implement it in the data pipeline, which I can assume is in dbt and already writes to the correct place and format, while adding relevant data tests to make sure the pipeline remains consistent
- What makes a good data warehouse?
	- Focus on two dimensions: resiliency and efficiency
	- Resilient
		- Easily receive, integrate and make data available
		- Well-modeled for use cases, with proper documentation and access controls
		- Clear ownership of data assets inside the company
	- Efficient
		- Model quality comes back, since it can impact performance. Can use strategies such as incrementalization
		- Should not scale in costs as the business or data scales
		- Have the ability to keep up with the speed of the business and not depend on individual people
### Questions
1. Due to Analytics Engineers usually being versatile professionals, I've seen the responsibilities become less clear as the company grows, orienting for instance more to the BI side or to the Engineering side. How do you see that at Monzo?
2. I've asked << Theo and Himesh >> in my previous chat about "the good and the bad" for the Analytics Engineering chapter at Monzo, and I feel your thoughts would be really rich as well!
3. At what point in the hierarchy does the structure break between discipline (AE) and business? Where are the most senior AEs in the company located?
4. Interaction between hub and spoke.
### Notes
- Balance: people may want to learn more
- In a place where people are mostly doing the same thing (data modeling), bulk of the work there
- Hiring the right people for the right job
- Align with stakeholders
- Think about the exposition for the team members
- There is no "head of AE" role
- AE managers report into business
- There are 3 senior AE managers 
- There are Data Directors that typically

## Prep for final stage
### Monzo’s data stack
- Clear ownership of data from production to analytical stack
- Feature Store to connect analytical to production environment using Cassandra
- Internal data health reporting
- Internal tools (e.g. CLI) developed by “the hub” team to support specific processes (e.g. ingesting a new event)
- Implemented an `indirect_ref` similar to last healthy model scores, to decouple the lineages but still have a dependency
- Challenges
	- Seamlessly propagating the effect of code changes (may be solved by microbatch on dbt 1.9)
	- Preventing accidental time bombs
	- Decentralize the monolithic dbt project
	- Further cost reductions in the pipeline (Airflow + dbt)
### dbt new features
- Version models
- Incremental improvements
- Python models in BigQuery using Dataproc
- microbatch as a strategy for incremental models

## Helper chat
[[2024-11-14-Thursday]]
Annabel Coleman

- What is the focus of the next stage? Is it expected to be the final stage?
	- Three stages
		- Collaboration
			- Collaboration with engineering - with back-end engineering team
			- AE highly cross-functional
			- Simulate an interaction between an engineer and an AE
			- First 15min: traditional interview-style questions (draw examples from times that I've worked with engineers, challenges) -> get a gauge of previous collaboration with engineers
			- Way that I've led in previous experiences
			- 45min: case study 
				- We're two backend engineers, this is the problem, you're the data expert to help us
				- The things being assessed: communication to reason through approaches, ability to challenge and define premises
				- Driving the discussion but also taking into consideration the perspective
				- They'll make suggestion that probably aren't the best way
				- Very interactive, back and forth
		- Case Study
			- Essentially a role play with AE people
			- Klara and TBC (someone at my level)
			- Present two problems at Monzo
			- Set the scene and context
			- 5 or so minutes to digest (maybe offline)
			- Spend first minutes asking challenging with clarifying questions, while voicing assumptions to work together as a team
			- Not live coding, looking as a senior lead to drive the conversation, but playing as a role to collaborate
			- Both are very ambiguous
			- 1
				- Code interpretation and ownership
				- Approach to best practices on data modeling, documentation, transformation, best practices, first principles
			- 2
				- Architectural thinking
				- Ambiguous, how I tackle
		- Technical Leadership
			- Traditional interview style
			- Example-based questions
			- Looking for 
				- How I've previously set a high technical bar
				- How I can handle ambiguity
				- How I can self-reflect (problems/challenges and the impact)
				- Being proactive
			- Blend of technical questions and leading people
			- Technical challenges, and how I've dealt with that

- AE is prioritized by the business and by the Data discipline

- Which pieces of knowledge the team expects to cover?
	- Technical (specific)
	- Behavioral or background
- We'll have three moments with different people from the company. To make sure I'm effective, which questions should I ask tho whom?
	- What sort of questions: 
		- Collab: how backend and engineering works with data and which are the biggest challenges
		- Case study: AE managers on the same level, their unique challenges, biggest thing coming up, insight on culture
		- Technical leadership: Data Director, not in AE but DS, inside view on the direction of the Data discipline but also they value and see the collaboration with AE, maybe something on stakeholder relationship
	- People are either long tenure or heavily involved with Analytics Engineering
- Is there any feedback or concern from our conversations so far that the team would like me to explore in the next phase?
	- holistic overview of the landing time refactoring, did well in outline the technical decisions, articulated awareness of the main stakeholders of the project and the trade-offs
	- constructive feedback: at times advise to slow down and digest, sometimes the response weren't quite deep
	- pros: technical side, data modeling, demonstrate knowledge

- Pitch
	- Music -> QMUL
	- Data Mining
	- Worked in startups since 2013
	- Loft - from 6th person to Senior Manager of the whole 32-person team
	- Implemented and re-implemented the data platform, including dbt, heavy usage of Looker, internal Data Platform and Analytics Engineering teams
	- Had the opportunity to share some times, including at Coalesce, where I also got dbt Certified
	- Team went from 32 to 6 people, I focused on People Analytics but didn't have the room in the company to continue growing at an IC career
	- Made the migration to IC at Nubank, working in depth with Spark and generating direct impact in lineage and costs
- Bio
	- Facilitator, musician and engineer. Prefers dogs to cats, and on the weekends likes to read about mixology. Passionate about technology and self-knowledge, and likes to combine the two to be a bit better every day. Helps businesses and people to make sense of data, currently as a Lead Analytics Engineer at Nubank. Is a teacher and mentor in data, programming and career development.
- Quick results
	- Shaping the analytical platform while making other people in the team perform better
	- Hunting, selecting and training more than 80% of the team
	- Holistic view on how the company works, a lot of times creating connections between teams
		- Finance/FP&A <> other teams to define concepts and metrics, as well as data sources
		- Bridge between engineering and operations teams in defining processes to derive good quality data
	- Implementing modern data stack tools and being featured more than once in workshops or events (e.g. Databricks, Looker, Coalesce)
- STAR Examples
	- Nubank Landing Time
		- S: Growing time to process credit policies for the Lending business, up to 80 hours for the daily ETL.
		- T: Reduce time to process the ETL, while maintaining governance and quality standards and keeping sync with 40+ BAs and AEs.
		- A: Implemented an incremental structure that decouples the output of models and policies through snapshots. Less than 1% of Nubank's data platform uses incrementalization at the moment.
		- R: Reduced the Landing Time to 36 hours, as well as reducing the number of incidents from dependencies in the models lineage.
	- Loft Data Platform
		- S: Problem identified in governance and ownership of data sources, between SaaS and internal microservices.
		- T: Democratize in 30 squads the responsibility for the quality of data generated by processes.
		- A: Besides conducting this process on the Analytics team's side, I've acted as PM for the Data Platform team at the moment we standardized the way data is published internally to the DL and the governance in the usage of Databricks resources (e.g. clusters, unity catalog) for the whole company.
		- R: In less than 3 months, 90% of the data sources had an accountable squad and didn't need for the Analytics team to act on the extraction, further strengthening best practices and creating the foundation for data contracts and the Analytics Engineering team.
	- Analytics Ops
		- S: O time de Analytics era uma estrutura centralizada, com 5 lideranças que se dividiam por frente de negócio. Conforme nossa plataforma analítica cresceu, perdemos o controle de governança em todas as etapas e ferramentas: DAG e custos de transformação, conceito de métricas, visualizações
		- T: A solução do problema por conscientização e co-responsabilização (feita pela liderança da área) não funcionou. Era necessário rever a estratégia, dado que a perspectiva continuava sendo de crescimento
		- A: Desenhei um plano e implementamos a criação do time de Analytics Ops, uma estrutura Hub com o objetivo de criar ferramentas e processos que seriam usados por todos os times de Analytics (35 pessoas, 5 lideranças). Os times alocados em BUs eram liderados por meus pares, portanto a implementação foi pautada em entendimento de necessidades e influência lateral
		- R: Geramos redução de 30% em custo de Databricks, otimizando o projeto do dbt e os conceitos que eram representados por cada camada de transformação, e aumentamos em 15% o número de WAU em conteúdos curados no Looker, mantendo o volume de WAU total em aproximadamente 40% da empresa
	- Contratos de Dados
		- S: O time de plataforma de dados evoluiu e os squads na sua grande maioria já se responsabilizavam pela ingestão dos dados de aplicações sob sua responsabilidade no DL, mas incidentes de qualidade de dados eram frequentes
		- T: Era necessário entender e solucionar as principais causas dos problemas de qualidade de dados
		- A: Representei o time de Analytics em uma iniciativa que desenhou e implementou o processo de report e documentação de incidentes, em que observamos um baseline de 10 incidentes de dados analíticos por semana, grande parte deles sendo relacionados à qualidade na ingestão de dados. Trabalhamos junto com o time de Data Platform para implementar o ferramental e boas práticas de contratos de dados em uma solução proprietária, que evolui o ferramental de ingestão para garantir comprometimento a determinado schema e expectativas
		- R: Dentro do Q, reduzimos de 10 para 1 incidente de dados por semana, aumentando a maturidade de pipelines críticos e responsabilizando os times donos dos dados no processo
- FAQ
	- Why Monzo
		- I'm considering leaving my current company in such a short tenure due to (1) culture differences between senior leaders, making it so that teams don't feel like being in the same boat, and (2) lack of support from my current senior leadership to Data in the BU - it can be solved in internal movements.
		- I've participated on 0-1, 1-100, now 100-
		- Continuing to internationalize the career, Nubank is already a very diverse and international company and product, but me and my partner are in a moment in our lives to make these kinds of movements
	- Why AE
		- Understanding why and the types of problems it was created to solve
		- Deep belief that Analytics is and can be developed as a discipline
		- Can solve concrete problems of people using data, as well as getting more business users to interact with well-modeled data assets
	- O que quero desenvolver
		- Sedimentar conhecimento técnico - tenho experiência em bastante coisa
		- Ter outras referências - hoje sou a principal pessoa na disciplina
	- Por que IC
		- Hipótese que quero testar
		- Acho que consigo contribuir muito
		- Liderança horizontal
	- Maiores entregas
		- Implementação da plataforma analítica incluindo ponta a ponta + governança
		- Construção do time, de seleção a treinamento
		- Liderança de construções de negócio em diversas unidades de negócio
			- Entregas principais: estrutura de mensuração de portfolio, otimização de processos, identificação de alavancas comerciais
		- Criação de interface com times de Produto e Engenharia
	- Maior falha
		- Identificar algumas coisas e sentar em cima (ex.: pessoas no time que precisavam de feedbacks difíceis)
