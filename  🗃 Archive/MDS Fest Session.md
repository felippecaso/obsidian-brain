# A journey to personal analytics with the modern data stack

## Storytelling
- Idea 1: we think about data in an organized way
	- Tools, processes, being in conferences
- Idea 2: we generate a lot of data about ourselves
	- The concept of personal analytics or quantified self, with examples
- Idea 1 + Idea 2: why not use the methods and tools we practice for our data?
- How I started to play with it: without the tools or process
- Naturally, it came to my mind the possibility to use the modern data stack for that
- First: finances
- Then: health
- Showcase solution
- Future possibilities
- Did I _need_ to do it? No. But it was a fun and learning experience
