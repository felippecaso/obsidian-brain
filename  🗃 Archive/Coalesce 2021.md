### Notes
-   Markets create the technology, not the other way around
-   The data ecosystem doesn’t have the same level of maturity than the software ecosystem, since a short time ago software was the biggest differentiator in a solution/company
	-   All of the differentiation outside branding is actually due to data. Everything else may be hard but it’s sufficiently mature
-   We’re still using switches and routers even if we’re building blockchain whatevers. The same applies to data: the market is changing, but we still need standards and basics (such as dbt, btw) that support everything else.
-   Most activity around a16z other than crypto is data
-   Tech built on top of what’s being created is what’s going to last
-   Software is an engineering practice (you have modules, systems, APIs, etc etc). It may not be that this is the same with data. Dealing with data is like dealing with the complexities of the universe
	-   We could be at the verge of an entirely new discipline, with different kinds of professionals
-   Analyst <> ML // Tomeito <> Tomáto
	-  That’s all about building systems that optimize the use of data
-   There’s not enough time to optimize, too much to build! (controversial)
-   If you want to grow up together with a market, you have to live with a chaotic environment
	-   Your organization has to decide in what part of the stability/adoption curve it wants to live in
-   We all became massive software consumers from 2009-ish on (up until then it was restricted to computers, industries and such - you had to physically purchase software)
	-   Now there are pro-sumer apps that don’t have a sales force but create a massive gain in productivity
	-   Data may go through the same renaissance
	-   Software has a mostly deterministic output (you press a button, a light turns on). Data and analysis do not have the same kind of behavior
-   Things you can apply data to are basically the natural world (different to tackling specific problems such as climate change or water pollution)

## Beyond the Box: Stop relying on your Black co-worker to help you build a diverse team
[[2021-12-07-Tuesday]]

[Recording](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/xh130x6o/30)

### Notes
- Top 5s
	- Sourcing
		- Go to where diverse talent is
	- Advocating
		- Talk about it
		- With your recruiter, with your peers, in your job postings
	- Acknowledge bias
		- Check yo self before you wreck yo self
		- Examples: no more LinkedIn stalking/resume reading or small talk
	- Never get high on your own supply
		- Aka Employee Referral Program
		- Men of color were 26% less likely and women of color were 35% less likely to report receiving an employee referral than their white male counterparts (HBR)
	- Get in formation
		- Have scorecards and expectations for every step of the process
		- Create a binary interview funnel
- Building a diverse team is a marathon, not a race
- "If you're asking for 5 years of experience, you're filtering out people who weren't welcome in a space 5 years ago"
- Mind your metaphors
- Diverse people have no other role at the company than their own. Advocating for diversity is not the job of black people (or other diverse profiles)

## To All The Data Managers We've Loved Before
[[2021-12-09-Thursday]]
Adam Stone and Paige Berry
[Recording](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/xh130x6o/63)

### Notes
*5 love letters*
1. Expectations
	- Saying no to others, and showing us how to say no
	- Dividing work into different-sized buckets
	- Reframing as linear work, not circular work
2. Impact on organization
	- Delivering insights consistently
	- Overshare, over-communicate, and distributing work widely
	- Monitor and jump in; don't wait for permission
3. Engagement with profession
	- Shared learning time
	- Reading channel and discussions
	- Asking how we want to engage, in what ways
4. People over process
	- Building trust within the team
	- Async unlocks "bring your whole self"
	- Asking us about how we want to receive feedback
	- PTO (personal time off) transparency

*Ideas for current data managers*
1.  Create and share guideline for work type time/percentages (or copy the one we use!)
	- 40% project work
	- 20% fetching numbers for others
	- 20% surfacing proactive insights
	- 10% professional dev
	- 10% chore work
2.  Create data-reads channel / repo / discussion forum
3.  Set PTO expectations, communicate them, amd create and share “PTO leaderboard”
4.  Reach out to the folks at your org who create and curate external-facing blog content, and see what the process is and resources are for helping employees write content for that blog
5.  Add a question such as “what’s interesting to you about being a member of the data profession, and how would you like to engage with it?” to your next 1:1 with direct reports
6.  Look into an async way of doing standups to take pressure off your team to “show up” at an exact specific time
7.  Watch [@emilie](https://getdbt.slack.com/team/U3BQ90MHP)’s talk at Modern Data Stack on [Breaking Your Data Team Out of the Service Trap](https://resources.fivetran.com/mdsconference/mdscon-2021-breaking-your-data-team-out-of-the-service-trap#main-content)

*Ideas for Individual Contributors*
1.  Think about how it works best for you to receive feedback, and then let your manager know
2.  Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKSGhOBnRPw) of Andreas Klinger’s talk about building trust on remote engineering teams and think about how it applies to your team
3.  Ask yourself “what’s interesting to me about being a member of the data profession, and how would I like to engage with it?” and share your answer in your next 1:1 with your manager
4.  Reach out to the folks at your org who create and curate external-facing blog content, and see what the process is and resources are for helping employees write content for that blog, and share that info with your manager and teammates.
5.  Ask your manager to come up with a guideline for work type time/percentages (or suggest they copy the one we use at Netlify!)
6.  Research and propose an async way of doing standups
7.  Be a good teammate and remind folks to take time off, or talk with your manager if it seems like you and others on your team find it difficult to take time off to recharge
