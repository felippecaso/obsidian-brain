# Data Council 2025
## Chat with Scott
[[2024-12-27-Friday]]

- April 22nd - 24th, 2025
- SF Bay Area

- Open questions
	- I've just accepted an offer to a new position in the UK. Still confidential, as I haven't communicated yet to my current employer. 
	- Content is tied to my experience at Nubank, although it can be presented in an "agnostic" way. Have you had any similar experiences?
	- I'll probably start at the beginning of April. That'll mean some back and forth between São Paulo <> London <> SF, and also match with the exact weeks I'll have just moved to London. You mentioned that at first financial support for tickets and accommodation wouldn't be available, right?
- Notes
	- I'm excited by the prospect of participating. A lot of recorded talks from Data Council, such as the ones from MotherDuck and Malloy, are often food for thought I share with my teams.
	- 

- In terms of how Data Council works, you'll have about a 30 minute slot to present and answer some questions. Then you'll go to a smaller room where people can ask you more questions in a more intimate environment. Your talk will be recorded and the slides will be available to attendees.
- Speakers get a free ticket to the conference and an invitation to the speaker dinner. You'll need to cover your own travel and hotel.

Talk Title: Advanced strategies for lineage optimization

Talk Abstract: What would you do if your lineage couldn't be rendered visually? As data platforms grow in size and complexity, it becomes harder and harder to understand everything that is going on a given pipeline. This session will share practical methods to analyze and optimize lineages that have been proven to optimize lineages by several hours. From the world of project management, the concept of Criticality will help to understand and address the main bottlenecks in any lineage, and replicate these analyzes in your own data pipelines. Using these techniques, teams at Nubank have been able to save up to 25 hours in execution time of ETL pipelines!
