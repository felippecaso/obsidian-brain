- Reflect on where you've come from, where you are, and where you want to be
- Gather data on yourself and your current development

## Guided reflection
- What do you love about your job?
	- Tasks, People, Culture, Processes, Time, Environment, Benefits
- What would make your job more satisfying?
	- Your values, your impact, what keeps you motivated
- What do you want to do more of?
	- What you enjoy, what makes you curious, unexpected wins, who you admire
- What skills can you leverage?
	- What comes naturally or easily, why others come to you, your legacy
- What are you not interested in?
	- What drains you, what doesn't feel stimulating or challenging
- Does your day-to-day look like your job description?
	- Are your next steps aligned with your current path?

## Organizational alignment
- What's your ideal work environment?
	- Do you thrive under pressure?
	- Do you want to prioritize growth? Or balance?
	- Do you like to have an undefined role with lots of space for exploration? Or do you prefer to have a clear to-do list?
- Is there alignment between your needs and your current organization's needs?
	- Does the role you want already exist within the organization?
	- Do you need to hit all benchmarks for the role, or can you over/under index on some?
	- If not, can you make a business case for the role?
	- Do you need to look outside of the organization?
