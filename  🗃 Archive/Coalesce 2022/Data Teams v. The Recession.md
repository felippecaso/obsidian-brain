- Scenario
	- Tech stocks plummeting
	- Layoffs everywhere in tech
	- Every budget item needs justification
		- It puts pressure on data leaders to articulate ROI
	- It's not really clear how data leads to more customers/revenue
	- Tools come in without scrutiny
- Three ideas to drive an ROI story
	- Core business reporting
		- You need to know KPIs in a downturn
		- Tie your analyses and insights to relevant KPIs at this point
		- Core reporting justifies a small team
			- Justifies some basic tooling: DW, BI, dbt
			- Doesn't justify embedded data team model
			- Only justifies a skeleton team of data workers
		- Most asks of data teams are low consequence decisions
			- E.g. how many users.....
			- Product teams want to feel rigorous and justified
			- Need a data point for every tactical decision
			- The answers rarely change a decision -> get a product analytics tool
	- Data-driven revenue
		- High ROI data work directly drives decisions
			- E.g. marketing optimization, product experiments, cost center reductions
		- A/B experiments: data team's money maker
			- Experimentation is a data platform
			- Experimentation is a measurement process: it succeeds/fails by data pipeline integrity
			- It drives investments in data infrastructure foundations
- Be revenue driven, not revenue informing
	- CFOs face tough choices in downturns
	- Data teams should focus on tangible opportunities
