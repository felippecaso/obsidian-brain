# Talk Proposal - [[Coalesce 2022]]
## Orientations
The video component is a fun part of our process that allows us to get a feel better feel for your ideas and session. We ask that you submit a 2-5 minute video giving a high-level overview of you In this video we want you to tell us the main idea behind your session, and what audience members will learn.

The pitch video is a great proxy for your proposed session and helps us assess proposals reliably so we can gauge and make sure to deliver on speaker support needs.

The best way to assess if my idea is the right fit for Coalesce is to consider whether your content is relevant for our attendees. Here are a few of our thoughts:
-   **Analysts:** Familiar with BI tools. May have experience with LookML and derived tables, and might not understand why they want to work like a software engineer
-   **Data engineer, Analytics Engineer:** Comfortable with git, working in the command line and writing code. Sees themselves modeling software engineering best practices. Often have a background as a data analyst, and understand the value of business context.
-   **Data Scientist, ML Engineer:** Spend most of their time working in R, Python and SQL. Used to cleaning their own data, competent in software engineering best practices and prefers to operate independently because data engineering teams and workflows usually slow them down. Will immensely benefit from access to well modeled data they can reuse in their work and an easy (CLI) interface to do this without messing up their Python environment
-   **Managers (Data Team Manager, Head of Data, Head of Analytics, etc.):** They have likely been through the trenches of poor data team practices. Maybe they have come up through a data engineering background. Attracted to reducing administrative effort and enabling analysts.
-   **Decision Makers:** CIOs, CTOs, CPOs, thought-leaders, C-suite professionals thinking about business outcomes. This person is ultimately on the hook for the success and failures of tech adoption. Has led data teams, and is vocal about new ways of work.

We are open to a number of different formats for sessions. Show us something new! Here are some ideas to get you started:

-   **Anchor talks:** Forward-looking talks establishing an underlying theme, delivering a core message that is part of setting the Coalesce tone
-   **Community talks:** Talks focused on how to solve a business problem with analytics engineering
-   **Panels:** Conversations diving into a relevant data topic led by a variety of community voices/perspectives
-   **Workshops:** Technical deep dive of tools and techniques
-   **Other:** We're open to your format ideas, too!

First and foremost, have a specific problem or closely related set of problems in mind. You should investigate or even propose a solution to these problems in a way that delivers value to the audience. You should be able to tell us about a problem, propose a solution or new way of viewing the problem, and then explain concretely how you will argue for your ideas.

Everything from a deeply technical session on custom snapshots to one about building a diverse data team is welcome at Coalesce.

Generally speaking, successful proposals come from folks who have already come up with a problem and a solution, with a narrative roadmap from start to finish. That said, be empowered to get creative with your narrative format. How you choose to tell the story is up to you!

The talk proposal you submit should demonstrate ample forethought. The more concrete you can be, the more chance your talk will make an impression on us (and audiences at Coalesce!). Don't get hung up on needing to be a superstar—we'll work with you on delivery.

We'll review each proposal based on the strength of the proposal and topic fit for Coalesce. Once we've decided on topics, we work them into an agenda, considering:

-   what timezone the speaker is based in, and whether we can fit them in on the day that best matches that timezone
-   the method the speaker will deliver their talk - virtually or in-person
-   content that's relevant to different attendees, and a variety of formats according to the day's topic focus(es)
-   whether lead talks will take place during a time of day that reaches the most attendees
-   we don't choose topics that are repetitive
-   whether we are missing out on an important topic area

## Content
### Brainstorming Session
#### About myself
- Analytics Manager, 4.5 years in data, currently responsible for structure the Hub to support the Spokes
- Currently at Loft, Brazilian company bringing home-buying experience to the e-commerce age. Startup-but-not-anymore (2k people, Analytics team of 40)

#### The idea
- In portuguese there's this word: *Insensatez*
	- In Tom Jobim's song it was translated to English as *how insensitive*, but in the original it also means unreason, unwisdom, folly
- Data people don't always have the correct incentives, knowledge or willpower to do what they deep down know that needs to be done, thus taking path that suits the short but not the long term results
- That's why they sometimes don't act proactively to create data tests or alerts and act on them to prevent data problems from coming up and scaling
- If you have to choose between drinking water and eating food, you'll drink water because you die first from thirst than from hunger. But if you do that every day you'll eventually die from hunger.
	- Maybe find a less morbid metaphor to say the same thing
	- When a ticket comes up asking for a new field/join in a Looker explore, the analyst has to choose between spending 30min to do the "quick fix" or invest 3h to understand the real problem behind and help to solve it

#### The question that I don't have the answer (yet?)
- How to leverage tools and culture to help human brains to do what needs to be done?

#### The presentation will talk to...
- *Leaders* that will feel understood by their peers and gain a framework to think the problem
- *Analysts* that will recognize their own bias and have a ticket to their leaders' heads and goals
- *Decision makers* that will develop empathy towards data teams

#### Hypothesis on how to address the problem
- Seeing impacts
- Prioritizing

#### Feedbacks
- Vulnerability: what I think could solve the problem
- Tools change the way you behave
- Collecting internal NPS
- *Cultural change*
- Being able to state the direction I'm planning to go
- Don't get too much in the context

### Form
#### Session title
How insensitive: why data people do what they know they shouldn't

#### Description
*Insensatez* in Portuguese means folly, unwisdom. In other words, doing something you deep down know you shouldn't. That's why it's common to ask for a new column in a table instead of working to find and address real business problems. 

Data people don't always have the right incentives or willpower to do the right thing. Therefore, they take paths that suit the short but not the long term results. That's why sometimes data tests or alerts are not created, or even acted on them proactively to prevent problems from coming up and scaling.

This talk will describe the feelings leaders and analysts have when facing micro decisions in making available to their companies, as well as going through ways to communicate and bring on board your team and stakeholders.

- Felippe, I speak from São Paulo - Brazil, working in data for 4.5 years, currently working as Analytics Manager at Loft, Brazilian company bringing home-buying experience to the e-commerce age.
- In portuguese there's this word: *Insensatez*. In the bossa nova song it was translated to English as *how insensitive*, but in the original it also means unreason, unwisdom, folly.
- I've been observing that data people don't always have the right incentives, willpower or even knowledge to do the right thing, so they take paths that work for the short but not the long term results. That's why they sometimes don't create data tests or alerts, or even act on them proactively to prevent data problems from coming up and scaling.
- I like to say that if you have to choose between drinking water and eating food, you'll drink water because you die first from thirst than from hunger. But if you do that every day you'll eventually die from hunger.
- When a ticket comes up asking for a new field/join in a Looker explore, the analyst has to choose between spending 30min to do the "quick fix" or invest 3h to understand the real problem behind and help to solve it. Put a ton of these micro decisions every day, and things will surely get out of hand.
- I've been working with my team and peers to combine the tools we already use, such as dbt, Spectacles or even Slack, to shape the behavior of both data people and stakeholders and help our brains to do what needs to be done.
- We believe the first steps to get there will be to get a better evaluation, at our company and scenario, of the impacts of each of these micro decisions. How much does an alert or broken test cost? How do we prioritize our actions and shape our team development based on that? But, to be really fair, I'm still figuring that out and will surely have a better scope and maybe even some results by October.
- In the presentation, I'll go through the idea and also share our own experience at Loft. By doing so, I'll be taking to 
	- Leaders that will feel understood by their peers and gain a framework to think the problem through. 
	- Analysts that will recognize their own bias and have a ticket to their leaders' heads and goals, so they can better meet expectations.
	- Maybe even decision makers that will develop empathy towards data teams
- I'm really excited to be working to solve this problem, and now even more with the opportunity to share it. Thanks for watching, see you soon!

#### Describe someone that will be excited by the topic
This presentation will talk to Leaders in data teams, who will feel understood by their peers in a mostly delicate subject that people feel but don't really talk about (hello, Data Twitter), and will also gain a framework to think the problem through.

Individual Contributors (Analysts, Analytics Engineers) will also benefit, recognizing their own bias when facing their daily challenges and having a VIP ticket to their leaders' heads and goals so they can better meet expectations.

#### Why are you passionate about this topic?
I've recently transitioned at Loft from leading a Business Analytics team in specific business areas to leading part of our Analytics Hub, being responsible for making our team more productive and helping them make our company better at data. For me, as the person who prefers to be on the kitchen side of the counter, this problem I'm working to solve is a mix of everything I love being challenged with: manipulating data, working with people for a cultural change, exercising empathy for other people's ways of seeing the world... that's the challenge that gets me up in the morning!

#### What tools and/or tech will be mentioned?
dbt, Looker, Spectacles, Slack 

#### Notes
I'm not 100% comfortable with the title, let's work better on it afterwards. Everything is open for discussion and development, your insights will be essential for that!

Thank you so much for taking the time to go through the proposal and for the opportunity to share it =)

#### What was your introduction to the dbt community?
As a dbt learner, user and leading the implementation at Loft, dbt's Slack was the point of entry for a great place to find resources and tips. Later, following Coalesce 2021 and also in some other talking opportunities with dbt Labs, the value that came from sharing and learning from the community was surreal!

#### Please share a fun fact about yourself
I've been practicing dad jokes since I was 15 years old, and the proudest moment in this career was winning a family contest against my father and uncles.
