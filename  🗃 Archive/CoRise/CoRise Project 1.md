## Questionnaire

- Who is the target audience for this article?
	- A Data professional (such as an Analyst or Engineer). They feel joy in their work and are interested in the subject beyond just their job obligations. They are not experts in the field, but are familiar with some tools such as dbt.
- What primary message are you delivering with this article? 
	- My thesis is that the tools in the Modern Data Stack can be used to analyze personal data, especially data about personal finances.
- What is the article’s purpose? What would you like the reader to do or walk away with after reading this article? 
	- I want my audience to become aware that the tools they use in their jobs can have out of the box purposes, so they can feel inspired to do it themselves.
- Explain why this article should exist. How is the reader benefitting from it?
	- The reader is broadening their point of view in the data industry as they see other ways to interact with the craft of data analytics. It goes out from what’s expected in a technical article by exploring new possibilities to deal with something every person in the target audience interacts with: personal finances.

## 10% Outline

### Concept

[The 10% Outline: A Quick Stop on Your Way to 30%](https://corise.com/course/writing-for-engineers/v2/module/the-10-outline)

- **Process articles** teach the reader how to accomplish something, so each H2 should generally be arranged in chronological order and begin with a verb.    
- **Explanation articles** need to persuade the reader, so each H2 should provide an additional reason why the thesis is true.
- **Story articles** illustrate a chronological series of events, so each H2 should further the narrative in a logical, coherent way — introducing new events or people.
- **For SEO-driven content,** your headings should clearly communicate what the reader can expect to find underneath them in paragraphs, bullet points, charts, graphs, etc. For true thought leadership, headings can be less obvious and more intriguing.

#### General format
- Title
- Framework idea (optional)
- H2s and ~3 H3s

_Feedback:_
I felt that the 10% Outline could have been a lot more helpful. While reading about it and trying to use it in my 30% Outline, I didn't really feel it was an intermediate step, but felt like a different way to draft. For instance, the 10% Outline template suggests to write H3's, while in the 30% Outline template they don't show up and are replaced by bullet points to support that section's header.
