Project kick-off
https://corise.com/course/writing-for-engineers/v2/module/project-1-instructions

- Briefly answer the questions at the top of the [30% outline template](https://corise.com/course/writing-for-engineers/v2/module/30-outline-template)
- Create the 30% outline using the same template

- Insights about the audience
	- Assume a good-faith audience
		- And in assuming that, the burden is on you to make yourself understood
		- The audience should not need to put in extra effort to understand you
	- View the audience's attention as a precious, finite resource

- Insights about the message
	- Thesis: a statement used to argue for or against
	- Often shows why or how something is important
	- Communicates the destination of the piece
	- 1-2 sentences - prioritize readability over making it work as a single sentence
