- AE as discipline

- ICs
	- Work on business problems with horizontal impact and orchestrate their solution with several teams
	- Free from people management
	- Should drive and push forward the vision on how the system and business works
	- Lead execution
- Point of view on structure
	- One of my concerns was that at Loft my position enables direct building with the whole leadership and management team, and at a larger company even with the same level of seniority I'd be in a much more specific and less broad role
	- As I understand it, the Core team addresses that in its attributions
	- Am I correct?
