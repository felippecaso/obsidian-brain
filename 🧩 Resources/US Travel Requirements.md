**You are considered fully vaccinated:**

-   2 weeks (14 days) after your dose of an accepted single-dose vaccine
-   2 weeks (14 days) after your second dose of an accepted 2-dose series
-   2 weeks (14 days) after you received the full series of an accepted COVID-19 vaccine (not placebo) in a clinical trial
-   2 weeks (14 days) after you received 2 doses of any “mix-and-match” combination of [accepted COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/proof-of-vaccination.html#covid-vaccines) administered at least 17 days apart*

If you don’t meet these requirements, you are NOT considered fully vaccinated. A booster dose is not needed to meet this requirement.

**You are required to show a negative COVID-19 Test or Documentation of Recovery from COVID-19.**

-   If you had a positive viral test on a sample taken during the past 90 days, and you [met the criteria to travel](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel/index.html#do-not-travel "Opens in a new window; external."), you may travel instead with your positive viral test result and a signed letter from a healthcare provider or a public health official that states you have been cleared for travel according to [CDC’s travel guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel/index.html#do-not-travel "Opens in a new window; external."). The positive test result and letter together are referred to as **“documentation of recovery.”**
-   You will also be required to confirm that the information you present is true in the form of an attestation.

**You will also be required to provide contact information to your airline before boarding your flight to the United States.** 
Your airline will collect this information from you within 72 hours of your flight’s departure. Access to travelers’ contact information will allow U.S. federal, state, and local health departments, and agencies to share appropriate health and public health information necessary to help keep the public safe.
