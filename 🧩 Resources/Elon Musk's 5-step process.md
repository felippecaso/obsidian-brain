# Elon Musk's 5-step process
1. Make your requirements less dumb  
	-   Your requirements are definitely dumb, doesn't matter who gave them to you.
	-   It's particularly dangerous if a smart person gave them to you because you might not question them enough
	-   Everyone is wrong some of the time
	-   Whatever requirement that you have, it must come with a name, not a department.
	-   You can't ask a department, you have to ask a person
	-   And that person must agree that they must take responsibility for that requirement

2. Try very hard to delete a part/or process  
	-   If you are not occasionally adding things back, you are not deleting enough
	-   At least 10% of the time you should be adding things back
	-   The general argument is "let's add this in case we need"

3. Simplify or Optimize  
	-   "_Possibly the most common error of a smart engineer is to optimize the thing that should not exist_"

4) Accelerate cycle time  
	-   If you are moving too slowly, go faster
	-   But don't go faster unless you worked on the other 3 steps first
	-   [[If you are digging you grave, don't dig it faster, stop digging your grave!]]

5) Automate
