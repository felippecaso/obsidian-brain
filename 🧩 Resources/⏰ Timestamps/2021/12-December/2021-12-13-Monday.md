## The Real Estate Portal Strategy Handbook
[[The Real Estate Portal Strategy Handbook.pdf]]
Webinar with [[Mike DelPrete]]

### Strategic Framework
- Clear shift in real estate portals to be involved in more of the transaction (2018) and becoming closer to the transaction (2021)
	1. Listings and Lead Generation
		- Average of 93% of revenue growth for portals
	2. Rentals
	3. Mortgages

### Growth Engines
- Listings and Lead Generation represent an average of 93% of revenue growth for portals
	- Growth revolves around 30% grow rates for Lead Gen business models, whereas other international portals with Pay Per Listing models revolve around 5-10%

### Next Gen Lead Gen
- US: monetizing Buyer Leads
- EU: monetizing Seller Leads
- Both lead to Lead Qualification (*by the portal* - less than 30s after submitting)
- Then, to a Commission Share ("if a lead transacts, the agent pays a percentage of their commission back to the portal")
- The systems are gamified ("talk to the best agent that's available now")
- The agents/brokers represent a small and exclusive group of the total pool

### Mortgage Expansion
- Major acquisition in mortgage businesses (with mixed results)
- REA Group: $2,1B EBITDA Listings // $58MM EBITDA from financial services

### Acquisitions and Divestments
- A number of portals are divesting to (re)focus on the core offerings
	- On the "Portal Comfort Zone"
