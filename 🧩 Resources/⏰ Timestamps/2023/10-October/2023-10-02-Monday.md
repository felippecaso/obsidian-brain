# üìù Notes
## Conversa com [[Raquel Oliveira]]
CAO @ DrumWave
### The team
- Product Marketing
- What are the team's main KPIs/OKRs?
- Team/role
	- Data Product Manager
### Notes from previous chats
- Desafio da posi√ß√£o: atuar como Developer Advocate // Partner Engineer
- Possibilidade de liderar uma equipe
### Results to share
- Shaping the analytical platform while making other people in the team perform better
- Hunting, selecting and training more than 80% of the team
- Holistic view on how the company works, a lot of times creating connections between teams
	- Finance/FP&A <> other teams to define concepts and metrics, as well as data sources
	- Bridge between engineering and operations teams in defining processes to derive good quality data
### Questions
- What does success mean in 3 and 6 months for this position?
- A lot has been being built on closed doors, and media exposure has been small. What are the risks?
### FAQ
- Why Drumwave
	- I'm considering leaving Loft due to feeling I'm solving a lot of the same problems
	- I thrive in 0-1 environments, and I feel Drumwave is doing that with a very solid foundation
- Why Analytics/Data
	- Understanding why and the types of problems it was created to solve
	- Deep belief that Analytics is and can be developed as a discipline
	- Can solve concrete problems of people using data, as well as getting more business users to interact with well-modeled data assets
	- Working on the other side of the table and being able to develop the notion of business <> customer data to Data teams
- O que quero desenvolver
	- Sedimentar conhecimento t√©cnico - tenho experi√™ncia em bastante coisa, mas o stack que trabalhei sempre foi muito parecido
	- Ter outras refer√™ncias em tecnologia - hoje sou a principal pessoa na disciplina
- IC vs Lideran√ßa
	- Hip√≥tese que quero testar
	- Acho que consigo contribuir muito
	- Lideran√ßa horizontal
- Maiores entregas
	- Implementa√ß√£o da plataforma anal√≠tica incluindo ponta a ponta + governan√ßa
	- Constru√ß√£o do time, de sele√ß√£o a treinamento
	- Lideran√ßa de constru√ß√µes de neg√≥cio em diversas unidades de neg√≥cio
		- Entregas principais: estrutura de mensura√ß√£o de portfolio, otimiza√ß√£o de processos, identifica√ß√£o de alavancas comerciais
	- Cria√ß√£o de interface com times de Produto e Engenharia
- Maior falha
	- Identificar algumas coisas e sentar em cima (ex.: pessoas no time que precisavam de feedbacks dif√≠ceis)
