## Highlights
* Memorization means purposely learning something so that you remember it with muscle memory; that is, you know the information without needing to look it up.
* Knowledge is at our fingertips and we can look anything up, but it's knowing what knowledge is available and how to integrate it into our existing knowledge base that's important.
* The point is that memorizing data gives you a bank of material to run through when forming and testing a hypothesis. When you rely solely on analysis as a form of knowledge-synthesis, you'll often reach the wrong conclusions simply because you do not have good data to base your deductions on.
* the point of a liberal arts education is to give you what to think about. Having literature, poetry, or even just quotations at the tip of your fingers makes for a more vivid, vibrant, and resonant life.
