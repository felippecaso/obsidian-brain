## Highlights
* Whether it’s the grueling approach of Musk or the leaner approach of Iceland, hours and structure are how we typically measure work, even though the relationship of time to success makes little sense.
* “For example, if I’m a client for an accountant, I want to have my annual report done well, however many hours it took your team to do that,” she said. “I don’t care if it took them a zillion hours or 10 hours. I want a good annual report.”
* “Autonomy means I’m self-directed and independent. So each day, because I know what I’m accountable for, I choose the best time and the best place to do my work in concert with others. I choose it,”
* This is the hard part about results-based work: * It comes unnaturally to executives and managers, given their contributions (how much does delegation and leadership really count for?) are difficult to gauge. * They also have the most to learn and the most to give up as they grant greater autonomy to employees.
