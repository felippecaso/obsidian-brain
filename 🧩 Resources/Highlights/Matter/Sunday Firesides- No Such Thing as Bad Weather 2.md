## Highlights
* Put on the knit cap of critical thinking — a mind that doesn’t fall for false arguments and is able to contribute sound ones; a few layers of conviction — well-examined values that won’t be blown apart by every blustery wind; a scarf of full-throated, sincere emotion that will ward off the cold of cynicism; gloves of real, concrete interests that will keep the blood flowing to your fingers; and a thick, heart-warming jacket insulated with the support of faithful friends.
