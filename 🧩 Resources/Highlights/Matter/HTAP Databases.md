## Highlights
* Some types of computation are hard for human brains in a way that most people just don’t really enjoy. In the same way that I don’t really like running very much—it’s work! Our brains have evolved to be lazy.
* when you are in the flow of trying to explore the space of a business problem, the thing you want is to minimize the time to insight.
* If you could write the SQL to express a question in 90 seconds but had a different way to ask that question that would only take you 10 seconds, that’s simply better. You will likely need to ask 10, 20, 100 questions before getting where you need to go—minimizing the friction for each one is critical.
* Besides which, the “being curious about a business problem” headspace is extremely different than the “write a complex query” headspace. When you’re in the curiosity flow-state, you should want at all costs to stay there.
