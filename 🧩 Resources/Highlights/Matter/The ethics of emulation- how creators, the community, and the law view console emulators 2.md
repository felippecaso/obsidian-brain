## Highlights
* "Emulation does enable piracy, unfortunately. There's no denying that," higan emulator author Byuu wrote to me over email. "But it also enables fair use. It's essentially the same argument as you'd make for a gun, a knife, or a car."
* I do believe in civil disobedience, when the price of not doing so is the loss of our gaming heritage.
* I find it incredibly selfish to benefit from all of the work done before, and yet not share in return. It reminds me of someone who would see a 'take a penny, leave a penny' tray, and decide to empty the entire tray into their pocket, just because they could."
