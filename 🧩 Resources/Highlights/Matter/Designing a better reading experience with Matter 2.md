## Highlights
* The term “reading online” really consists of several behaviors: deciding what to read, the act of reading, and what you do with your knowledge after you read.
* Consider how much of our worldviews, knowledge, models, and so on are the accumulated product of micro-decisions about what we read.
* Good curation is incredibly valuable, especially as a way of finding gems (often obscure, often old) that are overlooked by engagement-based algorithms.
* In general, our information consumption is heavily biased toward what’s new.
* increase the ROI of reading.
