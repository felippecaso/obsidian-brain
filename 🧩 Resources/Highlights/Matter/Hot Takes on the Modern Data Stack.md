## Highlights
* dbt lacks some basic functionality expected of a best-in-class tool
* Know someone who can guide you through common pitfalls.
  * **Note**: Isn’t that for every cloud platform nowadays? Specially the ones that require certifications?
* Do an ungodly amount of research to find the libraries necessary to automate the painful parts.
* Grind through the implementation, make a ton of mistakes, and re-write your entire codebase.
* end-to-end integration with a data stack at no additional cost.
  * **Note**: The Microsoft way
* Deploying a “production” data warehouse is unnecessarily hard and gated by tribal knowledge.
* Redshift is no longer a true competitor in the warehouse space.
* Airflow is obsolete.
* Airbyte is not production-grade software.
* Never before has the friction to building something been so low. With tools like Modal and Supabase, smaller teams can build amazing products.
