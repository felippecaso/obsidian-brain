## Highlights
* Nowadays analysts must know how to write SQL, use git/github, and generally spend a majority of their time writing code.
* I believe this gap should be filled in by analytics engineers. Their job is to: * Write production-quality ELT code with an eye towards performance and maintainability * Coach analysts and data scientists on software engineering best practices (e.g., building testing suites and CI pipelines) * Build software tools that help data scientists and analysts work more efficiently (e.g., writing an internal R or Python tooling package for analysts to use) * Collaborate with data engineers on infrastructure projects (where they advocate for and emphasize the business value of applications)
