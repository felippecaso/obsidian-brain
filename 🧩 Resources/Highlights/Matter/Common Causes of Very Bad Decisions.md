## Highlights
* Incentives can tempt good people to push the boundaries farther than theyâ€™d ever imagine.
* Tribal instincts reduce the ability to challenge bad ideas because no one wants to get kicked out of the tribe.
* Lots of little errors compound into something huge. And the power compounding is never intuitive.
* Probability is hard. Black-and-white outcomes are more intuitive.
* Being influenced by the actions of people who are playing a different game than you are.
* Too much extrapolation of past successes leads to overconfidence, stubbornness, and a narrow view of future risks.
