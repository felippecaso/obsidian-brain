## Highlights
* I basically read things that are either up to this minute or things that are timeless–
* You just need to be able to have a system that lets you think through the process…
* what’s the equivalent for knowledge workers to a pianist playing scales.
* You could spend your entire life only reading timeless works which is what smart people used to do.
* The sheer load of the number of things coming at me and coming at the senior partners here is just very intense. That has forced a comprehensive shift to a far more structured way of living.
* If part of your job is to deal with a large amount of incoming, you actually need to respond in a timely manner and not let people down.
* I’m thinking “God, I’m organized! I have a plan!”. If I didn’t have this, I’d be in a panic the very first moment I wake up.
* For any project, I’ve tried to identify the DRI. Who is the person responsible for delivering the project? If that’s me, then the project itself gets on my calendar. If it doesn’t go on the calendar, it is not getting done.
