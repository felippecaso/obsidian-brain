## Highlights
* We tend to equate complexity and difficulty with efficacy and worth. Simple solutions aren’t for us, because we’re not simple creatures — we’re elite, extraordinary beings.
* We’d rather try complicated methodologies we’ll never stick with, than humbly admit that, because we’re just as human as the next guy, the boring, ordinary, tried-and-true solutions apply to us, too.
