## Highlights
* * Monitor data sync SLAs into a central data lake * Define data quality rules and address failures * Maintain dataset- and column-level documentation * Provision access to other teams/teammates
* I say this from personal experience — resist the urge to create yet one more Google Sheet as a long-term solution for tracking data ownership. It will quickly become stale and inevitably turn into another lost tab in everyone’s browser.
