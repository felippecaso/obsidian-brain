## Highlights
* Most of the work we do in data is in an effort to reduce entropy â€” we model data to remove inaccuracies, we turn commonly asked questions into self-serve reports, and we funnel ad-hoc questions into a formalized request process. This kind of attitude is in our nature as data practitioners and largely serves us well. But in the case of driving decisions with data, we need to challenge our instincts and embrace the chaos.
