## Highlights
* Iâ€™ve narrowed it down to three basic tools. Here are my hand-wavey criteria for essential tools: * Tools that have been around for a while (for some definition of while) * Tools that are mostly environment-agnostic (i.e. you will encounter a variation of these tools in every place you work as long as you work with tech) and * Tools that are foundational i.e. if you know them, you can start to understand other tools
* If you cannot navigate the command line, you will lose a lot of productive time.
