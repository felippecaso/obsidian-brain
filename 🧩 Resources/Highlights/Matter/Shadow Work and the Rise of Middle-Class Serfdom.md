## Highlights
* While Mike hasn’t done anything physically strenuous during the day, he crawls into bed feeling exhausted. And with good reason — for in addition to performing his “real” job at the office, he also worked a wide variety of other positions: driver, news editor, gas station attendant, banker, waiter, bus boy, secretary, cashier, grocery bagger, cook, housekeeper, travel agent, and salesman.
* Since the 1960s, work hours have actually decreased by almost eight hours a week, while leisure time has gone up by almost seven hours.
* “all the unpaid tasks we do on behalf of businesses and organizations.”
* Rather than experiencing long, unbroken stretches of time in which we concentrate on completing tasks for a single role in our lives, we are constantly changing the hats we wear
* Every minute you have to resist the urge to check Instagram or look something up on google to focus on the task at hand. Each time you feel the urge to surf and resist it, you use up a bit of your willpower reserve. You’re thus actually working two jobs at once: one as Outgoing Accounts Manager, and the other as Chief Urge-Resister.
* Yes, outsourcing usually costs money, but this upfront cost should be weighed not only against the time you save, but the psychic energy and willpower you’ll preserve as well.
* Be a satisficer rather than a maximizer.
