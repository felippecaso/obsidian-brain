## Highlights
* We call this self-service analytics, and we frequently measure our success by the success of our customers (e.g. how many humans use data outside of the data team). Having customer oriented measures of success is a really good thing but this is only part of the equation.
* Sharing a code base means working together on code representing the same objects, on the same lineage, and on the same metrics to help avoid duplication, and encourage standardization.
