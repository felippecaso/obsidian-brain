## Highlights
designed during the course of evolution in order to make calculations about possible futures. This is what we call ‘deciding’. Since they elaborate possible alternative futures that would follow if the present were exactly as it is except for some detail, we are naturally inclined to think in terms of ‘causes’ that precede ‘effects’: the cause of a future event is a past event such that the future event would not follow in a world that was exactly the same except for this cause. — location: [1483](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B077QX7XPH&location=1483) ^ref-55570
