# Extreme Ownership
## Introduction
- "Relax. Look around. Make a call"
- One of the lessons learned after a day that something unexpected happened (chasing the squirter) was to establish clear guidance to the team on how far they should chase someone without coordinating with the team.
	- This is an example of thing that may get overlooked afterwards, but stands on top of an important thing that happened. A lot in work can also get overlooked, specially if those learning from the past have not experienced it.
- Extreme ownership: leaders must own everything in their world. There is no one else to blame. 

## 1. Extreme Ownership
- "War is the realm of uncertainty" - Carl von Clausewitz 
- The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit failures, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to win
- When subordinates aren't doing what they should, leaders that exercise Extreme Ownership cannot blame the subordinates. They must first look in the mirror at themselves. 
- As a group, the team tries to figure out how to fix their problems - instead of trying to figure out who or what to blame. 

## 2. No Bad Teams, Only Bad Leaders
- Leadership is the single greatest factor in any team's performance
- Once a culture of Extreme Ownership is built into the team at every level, the entire team performs well, and performance continues to improve, even when a strong leader is temporarily removed from the team
- When it comes to performance standards, it's not what you preach, it's what you tolerate

## 3. Believe
- Understand the mission's "why" from the perspective of whoever is handing it out
- In order to convince and inspire others to follow and accomplish a mission, a leader must be a true believer in the mission
	- Every leader must be able to detach from the immediate tactical mission and understand how it fits into strategic goals 
- Ties with Decentralized Command
	- It is the responsibility of the subordinate leader to reach out and ask if they do not understand
	- If you don't believe in the decisions coming down from your leadership, it is up to you to ask questions until you understand how and why those decisions are being made
- There are leaders who don't fully comprehended the weight of their position. In their minds, they are laid back, open to questions, comments and suggestions from people. In the minds of their team, they are still "The Boss": experienced, smart, and powerful

## 4. Check the Ego
- Everyone has an ego
- You are in charge, so the fact that he didn't follow procedure is your fault 
- It's not about you, and it's not about them. It's about the mission and how best to accomplish it 

## 5. Cover and Move
- Strategy to take back space: Seize, Clear, Hold, Build
- Put simply: teamwork
- Everyone in the team is working for the same mission 

## 6. Simple
- Combat, like anything in life, has inherent layers of complexities. Simplifying as much as possible is crucial to success. When plans and orders are too complicated, people may not understand them
- Everyone that is part of the mission must know and understand his or her role in the mission 
- The enemy gets a vote
	- Regardless of how you think an operation is going to unfold

## 7. Prioritize and Execute
- War story: trapped inside building with explosives outside. Got out through the rooftop, SEAL wounded
- Even the greatest of battlefield leaders could not handle an array of challenges simultaneously without being overwhelmed 
- Relax, look around, make a call
- Stay at least a step or two ahead of real-time problems, through careful contingency planning
- When confronted with the enormity of operational plans and the intricate microterrain within those plans, it becomes easy to get lost in the details, to become sidetracked or lose focus on the bigger effort
- To implement the principle, a leader must
	- Evaluate the highest priority problem
	- Lay out in simple, clear, and concise terms the highest priority
	- Develop and determine a solution
	- Direct the execution of that solution with all resources
	- Move on to the next highest priority problem. Repeat
	- When priorities shift, pass situational awareness up and down the chain
	- Don't let the focus on one priority cause target fixation

## 8. Decentralized Command
- Were I to get embroiled in the details of a tactical problem, there would be no one else to fill my role and manage the strategic mission
- Leaders must rely on subordinate leaders to take charge of smaller teams within the team and execute based on a good understanding of the broader mission (Commander's Intent) and standard operating procedures
- Don't ask "what I do", communicate "this is what I am going to do"
- Decentralized Command works and enables, as a team, to effectively manage risk, prevent disaster, and accomplish the mission
- Junior leaders must fully understand what is within their decision-making authority, and communicate with senior leaders to recommend decisions outside their authority and pass critical information up the chain so the senior leadership can make informed strategic decisions 

## 9. Plan
- What's the mission? Planning begins with mission analysis
- A broad and ambiguous mission results in lack of focus, ineffective execution, and mission creep
- The mission must explain the overall purpose and desired result, or "end state", of the operation 
- The best teams employ constant analysis of their tactics and measure their effectiveness so that they can adapt their methods and implement lessons learned for future missions
- Checklist
	- Analyze the mission
	- Identify personnel, assets, resources, and time available
	- Decentralize the planning process
	- Determine a specific course of action
	- Empower key leaders to develop the plan for the selected course of action
	- Plan for likely contingencies through each phase of the operation
	- Mitigate risks that can be controlled as much as possible 
	- Delegate portions of the plan and brief to key junior leaders
	- Continually check and question the plan against emerging information to ensure it still fits the situation
	- Brief the plan to all participants and supporting assets 
	- Conduct post-operational debrief after execution


## 10. Leading Up and Down the Chain of Command
- Leading Down
	- Team members who suffered the most and most questioned had the least ownership of the planning
	- Team members that remained focused and positive, and believing what was being done, all had some ownership of the planning process, even a small one
	- Leaders possess insight into the bigger picture and why specific tasks need to be accomplished
	- If your team isn't doing what you need them to do, you first have to look at yourself. Rather than blame them for not seeing the strategic picture, you must figure out a way to better communicate it to them in terms that are simple, clear, and concise, so that they understand
- Leading Up
	- If your boss isn't making a decision in a timely manner or providing necessary support for you and your team, don't blame the boss. First, blame yourself. Examine what you can do to better convey the critical information for decisions to be made and support allocated.
	- Major factors
		- Take responsibility for leading everyone in your world, subordinates and superiors alike
		- If someone isn't doing what you want or need them to do, look in the mirror first and determine what you can do to better enable this
		- Don't ask your leader what you should to, tell them what you are going to do

- Custo e risco do erro é menor
	- Possibilidade de fazer entregas pequenas
- Quais foram momentos que sentimos que era real e não mais treinamento?
- Ter registradas as formas de operar
- Quem executa deve participar do planejamento
