# Hyperfocus
-   Hyperfocus
    -   Understanding the four types of productive and unproductive work lets us step back and figure out what’s actually important so we can stop working on mindless autopilot mode
    -   Recognizing the limits of our attention enables us to become aware of how few things we’re able to focus on in the moment
    -   Hyperfocusing on our most complex, productive tasks lets us activate the most productive mode of our brains and get a large amount accomplished in a short amount of time
    -   Setting strong daily intentions lets us work on our most productive tasks
    -   Creating a personalized distraction-free mode, and a reducted-distractions mode, lets us work with more focus and clarity while directing our time and attention away from needless distractions
    -   Simplifying our working and living environments lets us think more clearly by taking stock of the distractions that surround us
    -   Cleaning our minds using waiting-for, task and worry lists lets us work with clarity and prevents unresolved mental loops from interrupting our focus throughout the day
    -   Becoming good custodians of our attentional space - by making our work more complex when necessary and by expanding the limits of our attention - helps us properly manage our limited attention

-   Scatterfocus throughout the day
    -   Disconnect from the internet between 8pm and 8am
    -   Notice when you finish a task, and use that as a cue to scatter your attention for a bit
    -   Buy a cheap alarm clock so you’re not immediately distracted by your phone when you wake up
    -   Walk to get a coffee carrying only a notepad
    -   As a challenge to yourself, leave your phone at home for an entire day
    -   Take and extra-long shower
    -   Make yourself bored for five minutes and notice what thoughts run through your head
    -   Tame distractions and simplify your environment to make sure your attention doesn’t overflow the next time you do a creative hobby
    -   Cook with music playing instead of watching something entertaining
    -   Go for a nature walk
    -   Visit an art gallery
    -   Work out without music or a podcast
