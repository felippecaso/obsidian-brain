# The relationship economy
Idea: divide interactions/communications between:
- What builds relationship capital
	- Dinner
	- Casual conversation
- What spends relationship capital
	- *I'm more likely to read an email from you if we've had dinner before*
	- Email is not fun, but is more likely to work if there's trust involved
